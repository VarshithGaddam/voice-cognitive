 is that you have to love what you do. for anything else is because this business is a cold business. it will take you out and it will break your heart. and most artists get taken advantage of when they're real young and naive. so i know through me loving the business so much. it never was a thrill that i was like, i just want to be loved alone when i get out. and as long as i can sing, i can deal with it. so put the music first and not the materialistic things that you can buy from it. or you'd be chasing that rainbow.
