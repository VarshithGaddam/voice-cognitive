 recently retired after 50 years with the los angeles times and the times america company. i was publisher for many of those years. i trained in all the departments when i got out of the air force and worked in every department. i sold advertising and i worked in the press room and all that. and then after i left the times i ran the times america company which owns other newspapers and media around the country. so that occupied most of my time. that was a great fun too. but the cars were a great balance. i'd get tied up in meetings. and then i just tell my secretary, you know, i just got to leave. tell the people i just can't. so i get my car and go out to a little garage. i had out now money and there were a few cars and horses. and i just to stand there and just kind of look at them and then go back to my next meeting. it was a good, it was a good, a good distresser.
